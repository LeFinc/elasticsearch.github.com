p. The cluster state API allows to get a comprehensive state information of the whole cluster.

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state'
</pre>

By default, the cluster state request is routed to the master node, to ensure that the latest cluster state is returned. 
For debugging purposes, you can retrieve the cluster state local to a particular node by adding `local=true` to the 
query string.

h1. Response Filters

p. It is possible to filter the cluster state response using the following REST parameters:

|_. Parameter |_. Description |
|filter_nodes| Set to @true@ to filter out the @nodes@ part of the response. |
|filter_routing_table| Set to @true@ to filter out the @routing_table@ part of the response.  |
|filter_metadata| Set to @true@ to filter out the @metadata@ part of the response. |
|filter_blocks| Set to @true@ to filter out the @blocks@ part of the response. |
|filter_indices| When not filtering metadata, a comma separated list of indices to include in the response. |

p. Example follows:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state?filter_nodes=true'
</pre>
