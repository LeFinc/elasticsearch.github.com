h1. REMOVED AS OF v0.90

p. Use the stats APIs instead.

p. The JMX module exposes node information through "JMX":http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/. JMX can be used by either "jconsole":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JConsole or "VisualVM":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisualVM.

p. Exposed JMX data include both node level information, as well as instantiated index and shard on specific node. This is a work in progress with each version exposing more information.

h1. jmx.domain

p. The domain under which the JMX will register under can be set using @jmx.domain@ setting. It defaults to @{elasticsearch}@.

h1. jmx.create_connector

p. An RMI connector can be started to accept JMX requests. This can be enabled by setting @jmx.create_connector@ to @true@. An RMI connector does come with its own overhead, make sure you really need it.

p. When an RMI connector is created, the @jmx.port@ setting provides a port range setting for the ports the rmi connector can open on. By default, it is set to @9400-9500@.
