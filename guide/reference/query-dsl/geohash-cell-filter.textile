p. A geohash is a hierarchical datastructure which allows a division of a spatial geometry. Each geohash defines a cell on the earths surface and the longer the geohash the smaller cell. Also the size of a cell can be seen as precision. The geohash filter provides an access to this datastructure by defining a cell and match only points that lie within this cell.

p. To get this filter work all prefixes of a geohash need to be indexed. In example a geohash @u30@ needs to be decomposed into three terms: @u30@, @u3@ and @u@. This decomposition must be enabled in the mapping of the @geo_point@ field that's going to be filtered by setting the @geohash_prefix@ option:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "mappings" : {
        "location": {
            "properties": {
                "pin": {
                    "type": "geo_point",
                    "geohash": true,
                    "geohash_prefix": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

p. The geohash cell can defined by all formats of @geo_points@. If such a cell is defined by a latitude and longitude pair the size of the cell needs to be setup. This can be done by the @precision@ parameter of the filter. This parameter can be set to an integer value which sets the length of the geohash prefix. Instead of setting a geohash length directly it is also possible to define the precision as distance, in example @"precision": "50m"@. The @neighbor@ option of the filter offers the possibility to filter cells next to the given cell.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : {
            "match_all" : {}
        },
        "filter" : {
            "geohash_cell": {
                "pin": {
                    "lat": 13.4080,
                    "lon": 52.5186
                },
                "precision": 3,
                "neighbors": true
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>
