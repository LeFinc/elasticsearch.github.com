p. A @nested@ filter, works in a similar fashion to the "nested":/guide/reference/query-dsl/nested-query.html query, except used as a filter. It follows exactly the same structure, but also allows to cache the results (set @_cache@ to @true@), and have it named (set the @_name@ value). For example:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "filtered" : {
        "query" : { "match_all" : {} },
        "filter" : {
            "nested" : {
                "path" : "obj1",
                "query" : {
                    "bool" : {
                        "must" : [
                            {
                                "match" : {"obj1.name" : "blue"}
                            },
                            {
                                "range" : {"obj1.count" : {"gt" : 5}}
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
                "_cache" : true
            }
        }
    }
}
</pre>

h3. Join option

The nested filter also supports an `join` option. Which controls whether to perform the block join.
By default this enabled, but when disabled it returns the nested documents as hits instead of the joined root document.

This is useful when a `nested` filter is used in a facet where nested is enabled, like you can see in the example below:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
{
    "query" : {
		"nested" : {
			"path" : "offers",
			"query" : {
				"match" : {
					"offers.color" : "blue"
				}
			}
		}
	},
	"facets" : {
		"size" : {
			"terms" : {
				"field" : "offers.size"
			},
			"facet_filter" : {
				"nested" : {
					"path" : "offers",
					"query" : {
						"match" : {
							"offers.color" : "blue"
						}
					},
					"join" : false
				}
			},
			"nested" : "offers"
		}
	}
}'
</pre>
